# Built-In Features

Built-in features are reusable framework capabilities implemented in `src/server/features/`.

They are different from:

- Third-party integrations, which wrap external APIs or SDKs.
- Pluggable modules, which subscribe to events and can be enabled or disabled.
- Product modules, which live under `src/modules/<name>/`.

## Rules

- Built-in features should be called explicitly when needed.
- Keep policy constants and strategy functions easy for AI to inspect.
- Do not hide product-specific policy in generic framework code.
- If a feature depends on integrations, read the matching integration docs before editing.
